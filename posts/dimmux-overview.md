_[Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/) is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting of psychoactive horror I'm working on._

_[Dimmux](/tags/dimmux/) is the codename for the megadungeon I'm working on for [Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/)_

Dimmux is a cyclopean city in the far Northern Wastes where [The Ascended](/posts/cursed-blood-ascended) have made their capital and their refuge.

It's built to the size-scale of the Ascended, and with their centuries of architectural knowledge. It towers over any human-built city. Some say that it is not physics but the Ascended themselves who keep humanity from building any structure larger than 2 stories. The truth of this is hard to verify.

Dimmux admits only a handful of humans every year, when the gates open. The Ascended within may come and go as they please. Although no visitor to the city would know this, the city is powered by enslaved Goetic demons, indentured by a few Ascended sorcerors, and they provide transport in and out of the city.

On Market Day (the day the gates open) much of the castle city is made open to visitors from midnight to midnight.

## Regions of Dimmux

### A. The Gates, the Trader Encampment and Humantown

The Gates are guarded but once inside allow access to a moderate sized settlement, occupied year round by human traders. One good market day is enough to set one up for life, and registration for the stalls is posted inside the gates the day before they open. Inside the trader encampment are the enfranchised and lucky few who live inside Dimmux year round. Some will leave once they strike it rich - others will live in Dimmux as long as they can stand it.

Region A will serve as the base of operations for a lower level adventuring party, as they can sell items they find exploring the city, purchase supplies, and rest and heal in relative safety. It's also possible to hire retainers and specialists of various sorts within Region A, although there isn't much in the way of sage advice here except on Market Day itself.

### B. The Outer City

The Outer City is the area of Dimmux that is most heavily occupied by younger Ascended, or those who still maintain human habits. This area, although nominally prohibited to non-Ascended, is mostly accessible to an adventuring party.

### C. The Farm

The Farm is where a handful of humans who are bred specifically for feeding upon live. They are treated as veal. This area is strictly forbidden to those who aren't Ascended.

### D. The Arcanum

The Arcanum is where the Ascended treat with Wizards and Witches of great power. This is also the home of the transportation system the Ascended use to travel while the gates are closed. Mid-level adventuring parties may be able to afford shelter here.
