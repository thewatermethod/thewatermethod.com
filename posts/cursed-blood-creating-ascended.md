_[Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/) is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting of psychoactive horror I'm working on._

I [recently talked about how the concept of vampires](/posts/cursed-blood-ascended) evolved when developing my ideas for the Cursed Blood setting into these Castlevania-Dracula-esque demigods that I'm referring to as the Ascended.

## Statistics & Sample Ascended

You will note that by default, the Ascended is very similar to the OSE Vampire. It's intended that there is some variablity with the numbers - there may be young members of the Ascended, for example, or ones who haven't fully realized their arcane power or built the locus where their power is centralized.

Stats should be rolled or customized for each individual member of the Ascended, and XP adjusted accordingly.
Most of the Ascended are lawful, but not all.

**Mesmerism**: Save versus spells at –2 or be charmed: move towards
the Ascended (resisting those who try to prevent it); defend the Ascended; obey the Ascended commands (if understood); unable to cast spells or use magic items; unable to harm the Ascended. Killing the Ascended breaks the charm.

**Regeneration**: A damaged member of the Ascended gains 1d6 HP at the start of each round.
