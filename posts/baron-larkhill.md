**Cursed Blood** is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting for my current home game. We are playing using a homebrewed system (very) loosely based on the game [_Miserable Secrets_ by Rose Bailey](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245941/Miserable-Secrets). That shouldn't be taken on the comment of that particular game, my group simply didn't enjoy using a deck of cards on Roll 20, which is our primary way of playing.

The system, which posits a world ruled by vampires, referred to as nobles. This and the general Castlevania of it all are all you really need to understand about that, and you only really might care because it served as a starting point for the creation of this setting. Like nearly all games I run, it has tended to bend towards a sort of horror inflected OSR experience the more we play.

My initial conception of the game, though, was that the player characters would inhabit the city of Basarab, a riverside city sandwiched between two powerful yet different vampires, and that the game would consist of politicking and adventuring in this city which was forever under threat of invasion and domination. I know better at this point in my game playing career to complain about things not going as I imagined.

The two vampire strongholds flanking the city of Basarab are **Larkhill** and **Thessaly**.

## Baron Larkhill

Larkhill is the estate of the extremely old and dissolute vampire, the Baron Larkhill. There are some who say the vampires, many of whom were once human, suffer from the same diseases of old age as humans, but on an appropriately vampiric scale and level of horror. The Baron Larkhill seems to be proof of this. The death of his wife, along with his extreme old age, seems to have gradually driven him insane. There are rumors that you might find him living in his own filth at the top of the large, ominous tower at the center of the Larkhill estate.

These rumors are true. The Baron is insane, and possibly suffering from some sort of vampire dementia. He spends most of his time sitting perfectly still in his small, dark chamber. Once or twice a year, he feeds on a villager from below, and he will oftentimes stretch that feeding out over several agonizing days, during which some awful screams are heard coming from his tower. These are dutifully ignored by his retinue.

In the time before, when vampires liberated the earth from the clutches of the great machine gods, Baron Larkhill was a great general. As such, the other nobles ignore his dissolution. His children take advantage of his madness to run roughshod over his kingdom and the lowly serfs that tend to it.

The Baron loved his wife, and loves his children, in his way.

The Baron appears as he did when he was turned, as a lithe, beautiful blond man of about 19. He possesses a wide variety of powers commensurate with his age, but largely favors the usage of enormous strength, his teeth, and his claws, as well as silently gliding in and out of combat when presented with a prey to stalk. He should be treated as an extremely deadly adversary fit for combat with a party of intermediate ability.
