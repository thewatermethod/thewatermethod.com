<ul>
<li>The Psychopompery are a fraternal order. Their members travel about the land dedicated to solving crimes and enforcing the laws, persecuting folk magicians, and preventing the conjuration of demons.</li>
<li>Psychopomps do not work directly with any Church or the Ascended, but they are popular or at least respected enough to be allowed to operate freely.</li>
<li>Psychopomps are taught the language that witches use to summon and converse with demons. They can understand it. However, it is a peculiarly feminine power, so they must wear a charm in order to speak it. They are provided this charm when inducted into the order.</li>
<li>Psychopomps are also taught a variety of mental powers, based on the classical demon-binding techniques of the Inquisitor-Emperor Salem.</li>
<li>Although ostensibly an order only for men, many women have served and do serve the Psychopompery. Sometimes in disguise, other times in defiance of the rule.</li>
</ul>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>Witchhunters can use leather armor or chainmail, as well as shields. They can use all types of weapons.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Mental powers</h3>
<p>A Psychopomp possesses the following mental powers. To use these powers, they should attempt to roll under their psychopompery skill. If the roll does not succeed, the Psychopomp may not retry to use that skill on the same target until they reach a higher level of experience.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with the dead:</strong> Psychopomps may commune with any localized ghosts or spirits. A ghost may choose not to reveal themselves, but most are desperate for conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Divine honesty:</strong> Psychopomps can tell if a person or creature is being honest with them. The referee may choose to have the creature make a spell save, or simply decide that the power doesn't work depending on the creature. </p>
<p><strong>Detect magic:</strong> Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures in a range of 60' are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed. </p>
<p><strong>Bind demon:</strong> A Psychopomp may place a geas on a demon that compels it to return to the infernal plane. The demon may save vs spells (DC 2x the level of the Psychopomp) to resist this effect.</p>
<p><strong>True name:</strong> A Psychopomp has a chance when using automatic writing to determine the true name of any entity they've met.</p>
<p><strong>Read language:</strong> A Psychopomp has a chance to read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes).</p>

<h3>After reaching 10th level</h3>
<p>After reaching 10th level, the Psychopomp is inducted into the secret levels of their order. They may call on other Psychopomps (1d6 Level 1 Psychopomps) to assist them with any tasks. They may gain other secret knowledges of the referee's choosing, depending on the needs of the campaign</p>
