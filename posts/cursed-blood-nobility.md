_[Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/) is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting of psychoactive horror I'm working on._

Despite starting from a place of "vampires are the bad guys", I noticed how [Miserable Secrets by Rose Bailey](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245941/Miserable-Secrets) never referred to them as such. I liked that. I was also thinking a lot about Castlevania, the primary influence of the setting, both the video games and the cartoon. To make them more unearthly, I decided that they were generally 10 or more feet tall.

Look at how big Dracula is there! These creatures would tower over humans. When wandering one of their castles, the furniture is at a 2x scale, giving the impression of wandering through a dollhouse.

I also wanted to latch onto an idea posited by the very first episode of the cartoon. Dracula wasn't just an immortal warlord, but his castle possessed a thousand wonders, and served as a repository for an incredible amount of human knowledge.

Taking certain other things (they mate with humans and produce offspring, for example) and we've pretty much discarded vampires as a concept. I started to relate them instead to the Enochian angels from the Gnostic gospels, who I half-remembered as giants ruling the Earth.

I've also been working through the first _Berserk_ hardcover from Dark Horse and I wanted to incorporate some of the the demon energy from that into these creatures. _Berserk_ serves as a great touchpoint for [Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood), although I think I would tone down the relentless nihilism for more of an esoteric fantasy.

## The Nobility in Cursed Blood

- The Nobility are and have always been.
- They own most of the land in the known world. Much of humanity works the farmland and pasture that surrounds their castles. They tolerate the existence of various cities and freeholds as long as a spear is never raised against them.
- They possess a variety of sorcerous powers. Some have incredible control over their form, with the ability to become mists or animals, others are merely thousands of times faster or stronger than humans. Very few know the viral language of control, called _Mormore_ in folklore, that lets them implant suggestions in the human mind. These suggestions are communicable and can unfold in small ways or lie dormant for decades.
- They know a great deal about human biology, having had a millenia to dissect and understand the human body. However, the fact that so few of them die has led to a dearth of anatomical studies on their own kind, and they know far less about their own internals.
- They reproduce sexually but are nearly infertile. This leads to them occaisionally impregnating human women. It's whispered that those who can become animals also father children with wolves, bears, and other beasts, leaving a wilderness scattered with magical chimera.
- The Nobility do not know where they come from, nor do they have any special cosmological knowledge. Many of them worship the same God or gods as humanity. The primary church of Cursed Blood is the Church of the Gift, which places The Nobility directly after the Holy Trinity in terms of primacy.

## The Castles

A novel aspect of the Nobility is their residences. They long ago mastered the art of binding infernal powers into the stone and wood of their castles. Their homes are thus nearly sentient - they often seem bigger on the inside, contain secret rooms that not even the owners know about, and are packed with magical artifacts and treasures. All sort of infernal creatures spawn in the depths of these houses, and it's difficult to take the same path through it twice.

It's just as well, because every one of these castles has a defense system. If activated, it transforms and takes on a new aspect - some grow into enormous towers, others reconfigure from stately manors into dungeons and bunkers. Oftentimes, the human staff might be wholesale killed by this transformation. Adventurers who've triggered this transformation are usually deep enough into the castle that escaping means fording a whole new set of traps and trials on the way out.
