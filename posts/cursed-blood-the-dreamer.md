<ul>
<li>The Witchhunters are a fraternal order. Their members travel about the land dedicated to solving crimes and enforcing the laws, persecuting folk magicians, and preventing the conjuration of demons.</li>
<li>Witchhunters do not work directly with any Church or the Ascended, but they are popular or at least respected enough to be allowed to operate freely.</li>
<li>Witchhunters are taught the language that witches use to summon and converse with demons. They can understand it. However, it is a peculiarly feminine power, so they must wear a charm in order to speak it. They are provided this charm when inducted into the order.</li>
<li>Witchhunters are also taught a variety of mental powers, based on the classical demon-binding techniques of the Inquisitor-Emperor Salaam.</li>
<li>Although ostensibly an order only for men, many women have served and do serve the Witchhunter. Sometimes in disguise, other times in defiance of the rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>Witchhunters can use leather armor or chainmail, as well as shields. They can use all types of weapons.</p>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Mental powers</h3>
<p>A witchhunter possesses the following mental powers. Twice per day per level, they may choose to use one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Speak with the dead:</strong> Witchhunters may commune with any localized ghosts or spirits. A ghost may choose not to reveal themselves, but most are desperate for conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Divine honesty:</strong> Witchhunters can tell if a person or creature is being honest with them. The referee may choose to have the creature make a spell save, or simply decide that the power doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Detect magic:</strong> Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures in a range of 60' are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed. </p>
<p><strong>Bind demon:</strong> A witchhunter may place a geas on a demon that compels it to return to the infernal plane. The demon may save vs spells to resist this effect.</p>
<p><strong>True name:</strong> A witchhunter may use automatic writing to determine the true name of any entity they've met.</p>
<p><strong>Read language:</strong> A witchhunter read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 75% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the witchhunter may not try to read that particular text again until they reach a higher level of experience.</p>
