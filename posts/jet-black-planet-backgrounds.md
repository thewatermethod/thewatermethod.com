**Ancient Dynasty (unique)** You start the game with 2 randomly selected spells. /+1 INT, +1 STR

**Hellspawned (unique)** You start the game with 100HP. You cannot gain or regain HP, and your max HP never increases. You start the game with 4 randomly selected spells. You roll Torn Veil every time you cast a spell, not just the second time you cast a given spell in a day. Your body is treated as a runic weapon.

**Anthrophagic** You have an insatiable craving for living human flesh. For each day you don't consume the living flesh of a human, you gain no benefits from rest, your doom die & your hit points do not refresh / +1 STR

**Rot** Whenever you roll a 6 on the Helpless chart, you may roll again.

**Resurrectionist** Each story, you can concoct 1d4 potions of resurrection. You may adminster this to any dead player or NPC. They lose the benefits of 1 exising background (their choice) and gain the _Anthrophagic_ & _Rot_ backgrounds. A player character makes a CON test, for an NPC, you make an INT test. On a failure, their mind is destroyed from death and all traces of their existing memory and personality is gone, and they are a shambling, mindless hulk.

You can also choose _Snake Blood_ from the Decadent backgrounds as if it were tied to your origin.
