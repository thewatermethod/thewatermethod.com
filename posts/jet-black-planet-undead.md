Received my copy of the [Black Sword Hack](https://www.themerrymushmen.com/product/black-sword-hack-ultimate-chaos-edition/) a few weeks ago and it really resonated with me. Typically (for the publisher) high production values and a mix of influences that line up really well with my own. I've had an idea for a setting inspired by a bit of worldbuilding from China Mieville's [The Scar](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-scar-china-mieville/14614161?ean=9780345444387) and the Electric Wizard classic _Funeralopolis_.

The elevator pitch: a world populated almost completely by the undead, complete with a dead ur-god at the center, ruled by mummies in enormous pyramids, ever growing, ever building. The labor, a resource ever in short supply, fed by a steady stream of zombies and Frankensteins. The low end of the totem pole would by the vampire, forced to feed on insects and vermin with so few humans around.

Such a world would be a magnet for weird scientists, necromancers, and resurrectionists of all stripes. The never-ending Great Works of the Pharohs that forever rule the Jet Black Planet would also necessarily be rich and thus the planet could be a clearinghouse for any amount of weirdness that commerce brings.

I like the weird science of the BSH and I think that is probably the level at which things operate on the Jet Black Planet. There is very little science fiction here. Travellers from other worlds may arrive but it's unlikely that players in a game I would run here would ever set foot on a spaceship.

The setting I imagine would accomodate much of the other business you find in the BSH (Stormbringer-style enchanted weaponry, low-fantasy adventure, the Fae, Demons, & spirits).

Anyway, here are d20 player origins for characters native to the Jet Black Planet.
