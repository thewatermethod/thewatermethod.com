_[Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/) is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting of psychoactive horror I'm working on._

_[Dimmux](/tags/dimmux/) is the codename for the megadungeon I'm working on for [Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/)_

Dimmux is a cyclopean city in the far Northern Wastes where [The Ascended](/posts/cursed-blood-ascended) have made their capital and their refuge.

### A2. The Trader Settlement

- 12 large wooden rooming houses (A3)
- Tent market, with bonfire in the center (A4)
- 3 Ascended guards, bored
- Impassable walls on all sides
- Path to B1.

The market is open all year to serve the needs of the Ascended within Dimmux proper, but flourishes the one day a year that the gates open. That day is known to the castle residents as Market Day. An enormous amount of wealth changes hands on Market Day. Ancient Ascended households sent seneschals to purchase all quantites of things. Some Ascended sell treasures acquired during the previous year. Others will take on apprentices for magic<sup>1</sup> or for other, darker trades<sup>2</sup>.

Three indolent Ascended guards are stationed nearby but nothing short of a large-scale riot, with fire, or an assult on the castle itself (B1) will stir them to action. They are disinterested in human affairs and will not involve themselves unless compelled to do so.

1. _Although Ascended lack the ability to create new spells, they have fine minds that can learn and memorize a great deal of magical_

2. _Ascended maintain an interest in power struggles around the world, and sponsor or maintain a variety of thieves and assassins guilds_
