### 1. The Gates of Dimmux

- **100 feet of sheer black gates covered with a thin sheath of ice**
- **Guarded by a single Ascended in a dark black cloak**
- **Gates opened once a year.**

Dimmux is built into the side of an imposing, snow covered mountain. Where else would a sect of vampire demigods build their stronghold?

The road up to Dimmux is wide and safe, but straying off the path puts travellers at risk from the elements and from various oversized wild animals (_2d4 dire wolves_) or marauding groups of 1d4 frost giants.

The guard is less than concerned about travellers approaching the gate. If they haven't arrived on the proscribed date, he won't open the gate them under any circumstances. He will ignore threats, and won't intercede if the party tries to forcibly open the gate, something no human can do without magic. Attempting to open the gate via magic will draw his ire, and he will give no warning before attacking them if he perceives an adventurer planning to do so.

If he is forced into combat and he feels there is risk of his being defeated or killed, he will attempt to _Turn to Mist_ and return with 2d8 other Ascended guards.

If the party arrives on the proscribed date, the gates will be open, and there will be no guard. Gates lead into the trader settlement (**[A2](/posts/dimmux-A2)**)
