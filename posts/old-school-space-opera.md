</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">

### Vehicles

Knight do not have the piloting skill. Instead, they may use the sorcerous feat _Superhuman reflexes_ to perform vehicle stunts.

</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Members of the order can perform acts of magic. Unlike Wizards, they are not limited to a certain number of spells each day. Instead, performing these feats has a chance of draining the Knight's health. Every time a Knight casts a spell, they roll the damage dice noted in that particular spell and subtract character level plus CON modifier. If the Knight chooses to wear armor, add that to the damage dice (it's harder to perform their ancient sorceries when wearing armor).
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Natural resistances</h3>
<p>The Knights are not trained in the use of armor. They take a +1 to AC when unarmored. Wearing armor may make it harder to cast their magic (see Magic, above)</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>After reaching 6th level</h3>
<p>After reaching 6th level, the Knight is expected to take on an apprentice, a level 1 Knight of the Order who should be treated as a companion. The Knight is resonsible for the apprentice's wellbeing and safety.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>After reaching 9th level</h3>
<p>After reaching 9th level, the Knight is expected to take an active role in the governance of the order. They are no longer expected to take on apprentices, but they should began work on a sanctum. The sanctum stores resources for the order, provides a store of knowledge, and a waypoint. A Master is responsible for provisioning and managing the sanctum. </p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">

## Laser weaponry

## The piloting skill

Any character who can reasonably fly a starship may do so without making a check. If they attempt something especially difficult or daring, they must make a piloting check with a d10. Characters with the piloting skill attempt to roll under their skill value. The referee may decide to increase or decrease the difficulty of a check, or that what a character is attempting is impossible. Those without the piloting skill may skill make the check with a 1/20 chance of beating the odds.
