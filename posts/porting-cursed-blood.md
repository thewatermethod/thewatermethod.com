As I've written about [before](/tags/cursed-blood), Cursed Blood is a setting I used for a homebrew campaign. We used [Miserable Secrets by Rose Bailey](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245941/Miserable-Secrets) as a jumping off point, mainly because I wanted a Castlevania setting specifically, but by session #2 we were essentially in uncharted territory.

The original game uses an interesting combination of DnD style tactical play/grid combat, a rigid turn cycle, and a playing card resource management economy. While I definitely think it'd have been a sound and interesting experience, my play group largely didn't respond to the board-gamey aspects or the difficulties making the playing cards work in Roll20.

So I threw together a homebrewed system that essentially ignored the grid/tactical aspects and replaced the resource management aspect with a dice pool economy. It worked just fine, but I kind of hated it the entire time.

Looking back, I think I should have switched to OSE or some sort of B/X immediately, because as we moved out of the structured style of play Miserable Secrets uses, we fell into the most common play pattern I understand, which is alternating between exploring locations and investigative/political role playing.

In addition, as soon as we dug in, we essentially discarded much of the world building in the Miserable Secrets corebook. The reason for that is - I like to make stuff up. I've never used a book completely straight, I don't think, especially something in the realm of fantasy.

This is all to say, I am now converting the custom classes and worldbuilding into an OSE framework. I'm starting with the setting's equivalent to the Fighter.

|     | Legacy weapon (1d6 DMG)                   | Bonus                                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>The Doomed can use all weapons and armor. When using their magical weapon, they deal bonus damage equal to their level.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>The Doomed can wield magical weaponry and cast spells from scrolls or magical implements. They cannot learn spells. The one exception is Detect Magic, as below.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Hunter's Code</h3>
<p>Hunter's Code is a pictographic language that only the twelve members of the Order fully understand. It is generally used to indicate whether a town will be friendly to the Order (all are not), if a monster is present, what sect Church is dominant here, but it often includes embellishments like clues on where to find a good meal or safe lodgings. It is usually carved into ancient trees or marked on low stone walls.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Toxic blood</h3>
<p>The Doomed are physically transformed by their indoctrination into the Order. Their blood is magically infused and replaced with an array of toxins and acidic compounds. If an enemy comes into contact with it, it can cause burn or a poisonous infection. If they are reduced to half of their hitpoints, they roll all damage die twice and choose which to apply.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Hunter's eyes</h3>
<p>The Doomed have one physical trait in common; their golden eyes. They have the ability to detect unnatural forces. Because of this, they can make an INT test to cast Detect Magic once per day. The Doomed are well known as travellers and their eyes make it difficult to hide their calling. Some fear the sight of a Doomed entering their town as it usually presages a violent episode. Referees should decide on a town's general feeling towards the Doomed in advance.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>A terrible destiny</h3>
<p>The Doomed are taught from a young age that they will die in the service of their creed. This belief is so pervasive that at a certain point,
they come to believe that outlive their usefulness and start to behave with an incredible disregard for their safety. As they increase in level, they become more succeptible to death and saving throws start to decline.</p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>Legacy weapon</h3>
<p>The Doomed wield a powerful legacy weapon that they've inherited from a previous wielder. At level 9, the legacy weapon gains an additional ability. This should be something that the player and the referee work out together. It should reflect the nature of the weapon and the choices the character has made.</p>
<p><em>Example: A player reaches level 9 wielding <strong>Bloodfarmer</strong>, the Kusuri-gama. Since they've played thier character as an analytical problem solver who prefers to talk rather than fight, the referee suggests that perhaps the weapon should cast "charm person." The player agrees but asks if it can function more like Wonder Woman's lasso, as a difficult to escape enchantment that compels those bound with it to tell the truth. The referee agrees!</em></p>
</div>

<div class="ose-class-feature">
<h3>What do you seek?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The village of your birth</li>
<li>The corrupt priest who killed your mentor</li>
<li>Your lost ancestral keep</li>
<li>The resting place of the first bearer of your weapon</li>
<li>The name of the demon whose blood you possess</li>
<li>The long-missing 13th weapon of the Order -- and it's wielder</li>
</ol>
