As I've written about [before](/tags/cursed-blood), Cursed Blood is a setting I used for a homebrew campaign. We used [Miserable Secrets by Rose Bailey](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245941/Miserable-Secrets) as a jumping off point, mainly because I wanted a Castlevania setting specifically, but by session #2 we were essentially in uncharted territory.

The original game uses an interesting combination of DnD style tactical play/grid combat, a rigid turn cycle, and a playing card resource management economy. While I definitely think it'd have been a sound and interesting experience, my play group largely didn't respond to the board-gamey aspects or the difficulties making the playing cards work in Roll20.

So I threw together a homebrewed system that essentially ignored the grid/tactical aspects and replaced the resorce management aspect with a dice pool economy. It worked just fine, but I kind of hated it the entire time.

Looking back, I think I should have switched to OSE immediately, because as we moved out of the structured style of play Miserable Secrets uses, we fell into the most common play pattern I understand, which is alternating between exploring locations and investigative/political role playing.

In addition, as soon as we dug in, we essentially discarded much of the world building in the Miserable Secrets corebook. The reason for that is - I like to make stuff up. I've never used a book completely straight, I don't think, especially something in the realm of fantasy.

This is all to say, I feel like converting the custom classes and worldbuilding into an OSE framework. And I'm going to start with the following fighter-style class, The Doomed.
