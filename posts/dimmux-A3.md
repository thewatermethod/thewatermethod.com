_[Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/) is the codename for a Castlevania inspired setting of psychoactive horror I'm working on._

_[Dimmux](/tags/dimmux/) is the codename for the megadungeon I'm working on for [Cursed Blood](/tags/cursed-blood/)_

Dimmux is a cyclopean city in the far Northern Wastes where [The Ascended](/posts/cursed-blood-ascended) have made their capital and their refuge.

### A3. Human Village

- Composed of 12 large wooden rooming houses and an inn (the Frozen Vein)
- There is a nearby tent market, with bonfire in the center (A4)

These houses hold the human folk who provide and store various trade goods and sometimes perform minor functions (decoration, mechanical repair) within Castle Dimmux (B1). Strangely, despite the appetites of the Ascended, they prohibit feeding from this village. Any Ascended who does so would be ostracized or punished by thier elders.

Each boarding house has three floors of six moderately sized bedrooms with an attached bathhouse, a kitchen, and a dining room. The Ascended themselves own the houses, but there is a human administrator (Cal Gulch). There are always rooms available at a cost of 1 CP a night. The one exception is Market Day, where rooms are rented by the hour at 100 GP/hr. There is 90% chance once the gates open that no rooms will be available, although if an adventuring party has the money and are there in advance, they should be able to reserve at least one.

The weather here is inhospitable but magic keeps the houses warm and comfortable all year.

#### The Frozen Vein

**Cal Gulch**

- Genial, eager to please
- Hardworking & well-fed
- Loyal to the masters of Dimmux

AC 10, 4HP, 1d4 dagger, MV 30, M 5,
Saves as Thief 1, Neutral, 50XP

Cal Gulch is a good natured man who administrates the rooming houses. He is diligent and keeps the homes in good repair. Years ago, he threw himself into his work out of fear. These days, it's more of a habit. He hasn't had an Ascended collect rent for years. In fact, he worries because he is having trouble concealing all his gold in the basement of the Frozen Vein. He would never cheat the Ascended, but will generally be helpful in all other ways.
